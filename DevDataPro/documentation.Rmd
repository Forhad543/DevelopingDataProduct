## Introduction

- This is a very simple demonstration of k-means clustering under shiny.
- Dataset is all.mammals.milk.1956 from R package 'cluster.datasets'.
- The dataset contains a list of animals and the constituents of their milk.
- The dataset have 25 observations on 6 variables.
- Data Source: *http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/spaeth2/spaeth2.html*

> Here is a look of the dataset:

```{r}
library(cluster.datasets)
data(all.mammals.milk.1956)
head(all.mammals.milk.1956, 3)
```

## Code ui 

- It has a headerPanel for the title
- It has a sidebarPanel with numericInput for the Cluster Count (range from 1 to 9)
- sidebarPanel outputs k-Means calculated centroids coordinates.
- mainPanel plots all points with the centroids shown in real time right after the Cluster Count changes.
- Code for getting the Cluster Count Input :

```{r ui, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
numericInput('clusters', 'Cluster count', 1, min = 1, max = 9)
```

## Code server

- It loads the R package “cluster.datasets”
- Then import the dataset “all.mammals.milk.1956”
- It gets the ui Cluster Count input-“cluster”
- Then calculate the centroids coordinates using kmeans function
- Finally it render the plots as well as the centroid coordinates table for the ui to display
- Code for the kmeans evaluation:

 ```{r server, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
 clusters <- reactive({
        kmeans(selectedData(), input$clusters)
 ```
